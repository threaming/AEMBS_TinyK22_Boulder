# AEMBS Boulder

Over the course of the module Advanced Embeeded Systems we implmented newly learned things into a boulder game.

The game is written in C and is based on FreeRTOS in preemtive mode. The baseline is set by @ErichStyger.

For hardware a NXP MK22FN512VLH12 Microcontroller on a TinyK22 breakoutboard is used. The TinyK22 is mounted on a hat with several sensors and an OLED.
